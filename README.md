# HighSchoolJava
This is my old Java work from high school. 

Unfortunately, we didn't really learn how to make stand alone executables, and the IDE the teacher had us using (DrJava) was really wonky on the Macs available at our school, so I can't guarantee that any of this code is runnable or is even written using up to date versions of Java. All of what I upload is my own, partnerless work, unless otherwise noted, and the teacher only answered questions (though he was mostly just a sounding board because we usually figured things out real quick once we said them aloud), and he never wrote code for us.
